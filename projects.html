        Split is a web app created to easily record and split the bill at 
        restaurants. It allows users to add more people to the bill, split 
        dishes among each other, easily see the totals for each person and
        Split works on mobile devices. An app for Split is under works.

        Rov was a project created for DementiaHacks 2015. Our research showed 
        that dementia patients tend to wander around the hospital and create 
        issues for nurses and hospital staff. The Rov was intended to be a 
        small, lightweight tracking device to be implemented into medical 
        bracelets in order for staff to quickly and easily note the locations of
        patients and other staff. It utilized LightBlueBeans as iBeacons and 
        a Raspberry Pi as a centralized server in order to dynamically track 
        position using a triangulation formula based off of the signal strength.

        The ThermoVest was my first year design project in Biomedical 
        Engineering. We were tasked with creating a device to help a paralympian.
        My research yielded that Paralympic athletes with spinal cord injuries 
        have difficulty regulating temperature. To combat this, my team created 
        an automated thermoregulatory harness complete with temperature sensors
        to monitor temperature and heating and cooling mechanisms which are 
        automatically triggered when the body temperature is detected to be 
        outside of an idea homeostatic range.

        When my uncles first came into my parents' new house with drills, arduinos
        and wires aplenty I was confused and skeptical of their project. But 
        they explained to me how they wanted to wire up our entire house to be 
        controlled on a webserver. I wanted to help and when they had finished, 
        they had it working on the webserver but had no interface for it, and it had 
        to be controlled using complex commands into the address bar. I knew that there 
        was no way my parents, or anyone else who came in our house, would be able to 
        use it. I offered to make an interface for it, and considering I had just 
        learned how to make AJAX requests, it was perfect timing! The interface has 
        buttons which send the command to the webserver and read the response to 
        update the UI.

        At this point, I felt comfortable with front-end development projects and 
        decided that I would test myself and learn a backend framework and make a 
        new project. One of the sites I personally have been using for a long time 
        is <a href="http://graphtv.kevinformatics.com" rel="canonical">GraphTV</a>. 
        I decided to make a movie accompaniment to it, just to learn and refine my 
        skills. After struggling with the asynchronous capabilities of node.JS for a 
        while, I was able to get it up and running with images from bing, data from 
        imdb and dynamically serve up a website that can give synopses and graph the 
        ratings of movies. I hope you'll find it as useful as I do.
