        Split is a web app created to easily record and split the bill at 
        restaurants. It allows users to add more people to the bill, split 
        dishes among each other, easily see the totals for each person and
        Split works on mobile devices. An app for Split is under works.

        Rov was a project created for DementiaHacks 2015. Our research showed 
        that dementia patients tend to wander around the hospital and create 
        issues for nurses and hospital staff. The Rov was intended to be a 
        small, lightweight tracking device to be implemented into medical 
        bracelets in order for staff to quickly and easily note the locations of
        patients and other staff. It utilized LightBlueBeans as iBeacons and 
        a Raspberry Pi as a centralized server in order to dynamically track 
        position using a triangulation formula based off of the signal strength.

        The ThermoVest was my first year design project in Biomedical 
        Engineering. We were tasked with creating a device to help a paralympian.
        My research yielded that Paralympic athletes with spinal cord injuries 
        have difficulty regulating temperature. To combat this, my team created 
        an automated thermoregulatory harness complete with temperature sensors
        to monitor temperature and heating and cooling mechanisms which are 
        automatically triggered when the body temperature is detected to be 
        outside of an idea homeostatic range.
