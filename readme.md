#Main Website - Kevinluong.xyz

##Motivation
This website was created as a first venture into front-end web development by learning
HTML and CSS. As I wanted to start from the ground up, I refrained from using frameworks such
as Bootstrap but eventually added jQuery due to the massive simplicity it provided from a coding standpoint.
In creating this website, I was able to learn many skills that were transferable to my future projects
(Flexbox, JavaScript, jQuery), and eventually this site will be remade in order to integrate the new 
skills I have learned since the creation of the site.
