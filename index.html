  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to my website! I am a Systems Design Engineering student at the 
    University of Waterloo that's set to graduate in 2020. I love creating 
    things, whether it be with my own two hands, with a couple strokes on the
    keyboard, or even with scissors and some glue. The first time I 3D printed 
    a housing for my first year design project that I created on SolidWorks, 
    I remember holding it in my hands and thinking "Wow! I made it and its not 
    horrible!" Since then, I've learned more about the world of software and 
    it feels like the only thing i've learned is how much more there is to 
    learn! On this website you'll find a collection of past, present and future 
    projects, I'll update it regularly as I make more things so stay tuned!

        Software! After being introduced to coding in University (why didn't
        I take it in High School!) I found something so immensely satisfying 
        about working through a problem, discovering the solution and having the 
        computer do exactly what you expected. There is lots more for me to 
        learn and I am constantly learning more and trying to make new things
        with the knowledge I have gained. In the words of one my friends from
        High School: "What's great about programming is that if I've done 
        everything right, the script will do exactly what it was meant to do. 
        The success of the program relies entirely on my ability to consider 
        every problem that it may encounter. If the program doesn't work, 
        it's entirely my fault. So when it does work, i know that I've done
        everything right"

        Men's fashion has quickly grown near and dear to my heart. I'm always 
        looking for sales on the newest floral shirt or a new colour of 
        button down that I don't already have. One of my favourite materials in 
        clothing is leather (probably has something to do with me being 
        vegetarian for so long) and most of my closet is from J. Crew or Club 
        Monaco with some notable exceptions for raw denim and shoes. My friends 
        can attest I get so excited when someone asks me 
        about the differences between raw and washed denim or why natural
        leather is the best thing in the world.

        On Sundays during the NFL season, you can often find me at home,
        yelling at the TV watching NFL games. My favourite team is the 
        Pittsburgh Steelers (Black and yellow, just like Waterloo), and 
        favourite player is Le'Veon Bell. Thanks Vontaze Burfict,
        you single handedly ruined the steelers season. Theres always next year
        though! Go Steelers!!!

        Sorry diehard Raps fans, I've fought it for so long, but I am no longer
        one of you. I've watched Paul Pierce destroy the Raptors in the playoffs 
        too many times for me to get my hopes up every season. Of course, 
        the team I want to win the most is the
        Raptors, but you know the old saying: "once bitten, twice shy". I think 
        this feeling is also known as "Cleveland Sports Fan Syndrome".

        In my free time, you can often find me engrossed in a paperback book or,
        as I have discovered as of late, audiobook! I enjoy fiction and fantasy 
        books that are gritty and down to Earth. Some books I often recommend to 
        people when they ask me are: East of Eden by John Steinbeck, 
        Colourless Tsukuru Tazaki and his Years of Pilgrimage by Haruki Murakami
        and The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera. I'm currently 
        reading The Grapes of Wrath by Steinbeck and listening to 1Q84 by 
        Murakami, I'm always up to talk about some of my favourite books or 
        to get a new book recommendation from people.

        Games, games, games! It doesn't matter if they're on the computer in 
        video form, board games or on the court or alley, I love games! Some of 
        my favourite games are: Dota 2, Path of Exile, Taboo, Smash Bros. Invite 
        me to a tournament or competition and it is on. No mercy. Ever. In the 
        words of Kanye: "second place is the first one who lost".

        One of my interests is: water??! When I travel places, my favourite 
        thing to do is going swimming in whatever local body of water they have.
        I've been swimming in lakes, oceans, cenotes and caves and love it all!
        Even better than swimming for me is cliff jumping into the water. My 
        personal best is 40 feet high at the Blue Hole in Jamaica but give me a 
        higher cliff and I'll be sure to as least get up to the top before 
        chickening out.

        Now, I may not be the best chef in the world (yet), but I think that I 
        am at least a very passable one. With dishes in my arsenal such as
        stir-fry, fried rice, OK maybe I'm not a great chef! But I can 
        certainly appreciate good food when its given to me. I enjoy eating 
        Japanese, Italian and Vietnamese cuisine, most notably any kind of 
        noodle soup from pho to ramen to the spicy Szechuan soup at Deer Garden.
